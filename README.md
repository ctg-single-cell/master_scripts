# master_scripts

This directory holds scripts and resources used for preprocessing of scRNA and GWAS datasets, with the purpose of harmonizing preprocessing of input files. 
Currently these are divided in 

* Conversion_gene_names (scripts and reference files pertaining to gene naming system and conversion from one species to another)
* Preprocessing_GWAS (sources of a "standard set" of GWAS summary statistics and scripts to transform these for use with MAGMA or LDSC)
* Preprocessing_scRNA (sources of scRNA data and scripts to put them in a uniform format, scripts for QC)
* Misc
